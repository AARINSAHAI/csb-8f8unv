    <h3>Revolt of 1857</h3>
        <p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in
        1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which
        functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.</p>

            <h3>1878:Arms Act was passed by British</h3>
            <p>In 1878 CE, the British passed the Arms Act, which disallowed
                Indians from possessing any arms. The British did not want a revolt
                like the one in 1857 CE to recur and hence wanted to stop Indians
                from having rifles and pistols.

                   against the unjust Rowlatt Act passed by the British government.
                   The Rowlatt Act was passed by the British government to increase
                    their grip on power over the common folk. This law was passed in
                     March 1919 by the Imperial Legislative Council which gave them 
                     the power to arrest any person without any trial. To abolish this
                      act, Gandhi and the other leaders called for a Hartal (suspension of work)
                       to show Indians’ objection to this rule, called the Rowlatt Satyagraha.</p>
