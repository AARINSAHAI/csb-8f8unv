      <center><p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of<br> 
        the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.<br>
         The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the<br> 
         garrison town of Meerut, 64 km northeast of Delhi.</p></center>

          <p>Since the mid-eighteenth century,<br>nawabs and rajas
            had seen their power erode.<br>They had gradually lost
            their authority and honour.<br>Residents had been
            stationed in many courts, the freedom<br>of the rulers
            reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their
            <br>revenues and territories taken away by stages.</p>
        
        
            <p>➤E.g. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of
            Peshwa Baji Rao II,<br>pleaded that he be given his father’s
            pension when the latter died.<br>However, the Company,
            confident of its superiority and military powers,<br>turned
            down these pleas.</p>

          <p>In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented<br>
            the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue<br>
            collection.Many failed to pay back their loans to the<br>
            moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had<br>
            tilled for generations.</p>
            <p>➤The Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company
              also<br>had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy
              about<br>their pay, allowances and conditions of service.
              Some<br>new rules, moreover, violated their,religious<br>
              sensibilities and beliefs.</p>
              <p>➤In those days many people in the country believed<br>that if they
                crossed the sea they would lose their<br>religion and caste,So when in 1824 the sepoys were<br>told to go to Burma by
                the sea route to fight for the<br>Company, they refused to
                follow the order, though<br>they agreed to go by the land
                route. They were<br>severely punished, and since the issue
                did not die<br>down, in 1856 the Company passed a new
                law which<br>stated that every new person who took up
                employment<br>in the Company’s army had to agree to
                serve overseas if required.</p>
              <p>➤Sepoys also reacted to what was happening in the
                countryside. Many of them were peasants and had
                families living in the villages. So the anger of the
                peasants quickly spread among the sepoys.</p></td>

        <p>Laws were passed to stop the
          practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage
          of widows. English-language education was
          actively promoted.Company
          allowed Christian missionaries to function
          freely in its domain and even own land and
          property. In 1850, a new law was passed to
          make conversion to Christianity easier. This
          law allowed an Indian who had converted to
          Christianity to inherit the property of his
          ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the
          British were destroying their religion, their
          social customs and their traditional way of life.</p></td>
